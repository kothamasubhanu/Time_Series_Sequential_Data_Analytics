**Time Series and Sequential Data Analytics**

This repository presents a collection of time series analysis and forecasting techniques using well-known public datasets. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

**Modules Overview**
1. Data Handling
   - Load and inspect time series data
   - Query by date-time index
   - Generate summary statistics  
2. Feature Engineering
   - Extract date-time components
   - Create lag features
   - Apply sliding and expanding window statistics
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Line, scatter, ACF, and PACF plots
   - Histograms and density plots
   - Box plots and seasonal heatmaps
4. Resampling Techniques
   - Upsampling with interpolation methods
   - Downsampling with aggregation
   - Visualize grouped summaries
5. Decomposition & Stationarity
   - Identify trend and seasonality
   - Perform stationarity tests and differencing
6. Seasonal Adjustment
   - Apply differencing and polynomial detrending
